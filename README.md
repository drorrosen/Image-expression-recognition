# Image-expression-recognition

Identifying emotions and expression of people.
This dataset has 7 emotions.

Contirbuiters: Mariia Padalko and Dror Rosentraub.

Steps - Since we have an imbalanced dataset we used image data augmentation in order to improve the imbalance.

The repository contains 3 exploratory notebooks and a .py file that we used for production.
